# skype-wrapper
Wrapper to show skype in the messaging menu and use notify-send to show incoming messages

# Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/wa4557/skype-wrapper`
2. cd to `/usr/local/bin` and create a symlink to the script `sudo ln -s /path/to/script/skype-wrapper.py skype`

That's it. Everytime you start skype first the skype wrapper is started, and should also be included in the Messaging Menu.
